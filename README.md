Latex Template
--------------

Simple Grunt build for writing latex documents.

Setup
-----

1. Clone this repo
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Open `document.tex` in your favorite text editor
4. Run `grunt debug`. This runs latex and opens up the generated pdf.
   It also runs a continuous watch that regenrates pdf when `document.tex`
   changes.

For an ideal work flow, use an auto reloading PDF reader (like Evince or Sumatra PDF).
Tile your editor and reader windows side by side and so that you can see your edits live.
